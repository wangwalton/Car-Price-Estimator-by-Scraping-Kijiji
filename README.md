# Car-Price-Estimator-by-Scraping-Kijiji

Hi all, this project involves web-scraping Kijiji data to download car prices and their attributes. I was inspiried to work on this after my mom instructed me sell our family SUV. Kijiji allows a pretty decent dataset to be built, especially with cars as their attributes for the cars are easily scraped and can be used as features to analyse the price of the car.
